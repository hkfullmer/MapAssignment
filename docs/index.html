			<p>In May, New York City cut many of its composting programs because of budget cuts, including its curbside compost collection through residential brown bins.</p>

			<p>DSNY compost drop-off locations are now more important than ever, but locations are not equitably distributed throughout all boroughs.</p>

			<p>Manhattan represents 19% of the city’s total population, but is home to almost 50% of the city’s drop off locations. Community district 5, which includes Midtown, Madison Square and Union Square, has  more than 17 drop-off locations per 100,000 residents.</p>

			<p>On average Manhattan neighborhoods have almost 9 drop-off locations per 100,000 residents, followed by the Bronx with 3.55. Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island neighborhoods on average have the least number of drop-off locations per 100,000 residents with 1.84, 1.75 and 1.2, respectively.</p>

			<p>The Bronx also bears the brunt of the environmental and health impacts that comes from hosting the city's industrial trash and composting processing plants.</p>

			<p>Compost and landfill facilities are often clustered in low-income and non-white neighborhoods. The pollution from trucks and the gas from the compost—leads to high rates of asthma and respiratory disease in these neighborhoods.<sup>1</sup></p>

			<p>Gil Lopez, a compost program designer and community advocate for local composting programs in NYC, said “In order for us to throw something away, we're actually throwing it on top of and through other peoples' and places.” he said.</p>
